 ------ WELCOME TO MY HUNTER ------ 

The goal of this game is simple: drones jump onto the screen and you have to kill them by shooting them.
Every 1000 points, a card trade appears on the screen: you can choose to accept or refuse it.
Each card has its own cost and unique power, described on the card.
You also have a killstreak: if you shoot 5 robots without missing, you earn more points for as long as you have the maximum at the killstreak.
GOOD LUCK !
