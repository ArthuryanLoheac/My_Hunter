# My Hunter

Welcome to "My Hunter," a challenging and entertaining game inspired by the classic "Duck Hunt." Developed as my first graphical module project during my first year at Epitech, "My Hunter" not only revisits a beloved classic but also showcases my programming skills and creativity. The game is built using C language and CSFML, a multimedia library designed for game development.

## Game Overview

In "My Hunter," players take on the role of a hunter, tasked with shooting drones that appear on the screen. These drones move in patterns influenced by gravity, creating an engaging gameplay experience. Players can shoot without limitations, but missed shots will cost them points. Accumulating points allows players to unlock cards with unique powers, enhancing the gameplay and strategy.

### Key Features

- **Dynamic Enemy Movement:** Enemies move across the screen in patterns affected by gravity, making each shot a test of skill.
- **Unlimited Shooting:** Fire away without worrying about ammunition, but be mindful of the points penalty for missed shots.
- **Score-based Power-ups:** Every 1000 points earned unlocks a card trade, offering power-ups that can turn the tide of the game.
- **Artistic Design:** The game features a unique color palette inspired by RESURRECT 64, along with pixel art graphics that bring the game world to life.
- **Custom Music and Sounds:** A techno/electro soundtrack perfectly complements the robot-themed universe, enhancing the gaming experience.
